# AI-Assisted-Resume-Screening-with-Bias-Fairness-Analysis
AI-based resume screening system with bias detection and fairness analysis using NLP and machine learning.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an AI-assisted resume screening system that helps automate candidate shortlisting while ensuring fairness and minimizing bias in hiring decisions. Traditional resume screening processes are time-consuming and may unintentionally introduce bias based on gender, ethnicity, or background.

The system analyzes resume data, predicts candidate suitability, and evaluates model fairness to promote ethical and unbiased hiring practices.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Resume screening poses several challenges for organizations:

- Manual resume screening is slow and inefficient  
- Human bias can influence hiring decisions  
- AI models may amplify existing biases if not evaluated properly  

This project aims to automate resume screening while actively analyzing and mitigating bias to ensure fair and transparent hiring outcomes.

## 🧠 Solution Approach
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on resume datasets  
- Applied text preprocessing and feature extraction techniques  
- Built machine learning models for candidate classification  
- Conducted bias and fairness analysis on model predictions  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Machine Learning & Fairness Evaluation  

## 📂 Dataset
- Resume data including skills, experience, and education details  
- Public or synthetic datasets used for resume screening tasks  

## ⚙️ Workflow
- Data cleaning and text preprocessing  
- Feature extraction using NLP techniques  
- Model training and validation  
- Bias and fairness evaluation  
- Resume screening and candidate ranking  

## 📈 Results
- Successfully automated resume screening process  
- Identified and analyzed potential bias in model predictions  
- Improved transparency and fairness in candidate shortlisting  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integrate advanced NLP models (BERT / Transformers)  
- Deploy as an HR screening web application  
- Implement bias mitigation techniques for real-world deployment
